A modification of the dilbert webcomic crawler designed to get all the XKCD comics and save them as their number. 

To run just type "python xkcd.py" from the command line. CAUTION: It will dump ~1500 png's in the folder you are running from.

It assumes that there are < 10,000 comics, which should be accurate for the next decade or so.
